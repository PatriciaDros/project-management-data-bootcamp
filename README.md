# Project Management Data Bootcamp
# üéì 8-Month Data Analytics Bootcamp ‚Äì Built by Me, Powered by AI

I created this project-based bootcamp to sharpen my data analytics skills with a special focus on the **Project Management industry**. I designed the program from scratch using myself as the student and AI as my learning partner and coach.

This repository is both my **portfolio** and a **learning log**‚Äîa place to track my progress from foundational Excel all the way to advanced analytics with Python, SQL, Tableau, and real-world data projects.

My goal is to:
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate a clear, structured learning journey
- üìà Show how I approach large projects by breaking them into small, manageable, goal-driven tasks
- üí° Reveal my logical problem-solving approach in action
- ü§ù Share what I‚Äôve learned with hiring managers and fellow data enthusiasts alike

I believe learning should be **transparent**, **applied**, and **joyful**‚Äîand this repo is proof of that mindset.

Whether you‚Äôre here to review my projects, get inspired by the structure, or just curious about how someone builds themselves up with AI support‚Äîwelcome. You're watching a career pivot happen in real time.
