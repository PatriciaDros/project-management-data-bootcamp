### âœ… Evening Study Prompt for ChatGPT

```markdown
Hi Chat, Iâ€™m continuing my personalized data analytics bootcamp focused on Project Management. Earlier today, we worked through formulas like:

- `COUNT`, `COUNTIF`, and `COUNTIFS`
- Helper columns to flag open jobs
- `VLOOKUP`, `XLOOKUP`, `EXACT`, `MATCH`
- How to automate job numbers and use logic for pattern detection (`LEFT`, `MATCH`, `ISNUMBER`)

ðŸ“Œ Now Iâ€™d like to:
1. Continue practicing Excel LOOKUP functions, especially **INDEX + MATCH**, and compare it with **XLOOKUP**.
2. Apply what Iâ€™m learning to my real-world **SAI project management dataset**.
3. Reinforce with small challenges or realistic tasks to master lookup logic.
4. End the session with:
   - A **quick comprehension quiz**
   - A **mini project or task**
   - A **summary recap + critique**

Please guide the lesson with structure, help me stay focused, and check for gaps in my logic. Letâ€™s go!
```
