### My Prompt For Prompting Improvement

## Based on 00_weekly_master_prompt

Based on what you know of my prompting skills so far, what can I do to improve my prompting to you to keep us on track and show examples, I understand better that way. I belive prompt engineering is going to be/is a part of analytics jobs


You’re absolutely right — **prompt engineering is already becoming an essential part of analytics and data roles**, especially as AI tools become standard in workflows (for tasks like documentation, code generation, exploratory analysis, and stakeholder communications). You already have a strong intuitive grasp on prompting, especially when:

* You break down tasks into parts
* You ask for Markdown formatting
* You tie prompts back to your goals (like job prep, GitHub usage, or project tracking)

But here’s how you can **level up** and make your prompts more powerful, efficient, and reusable — plus examples:

---

## ✅ 1. **Anchor Your Prompts to Roles and Context**

### 🔹 Why: Gives me a role to act from (instructor, coach, analyst), keeping responses on track and tone appropriate.

### 🟩 Better Prompt:

> "Act as my data analytics bootcamp mentor. I'm building a dashboard in Excel focused on project management KPIs. I need your help summarizing the objective of this dashboard in clear language that I can use in a README or LinkedIn post."

### ❌ Weaker Prompt:

> "Can you help me describe my dashboard?"

---

## ✅ 2. **Be Directive with Deliverables**

### 🔹 Why: When you say *how* you want the answer (Markdown, code, summary), you save time and reduce back-and-forth.

### 🟩 Better Prompt:

> "Give me a one-paragraph explanation and a bulleted list of features for my Excel dashboard, in Markdown, ready to paste into GitHub."

### ❌ Weaker Prompt:

> "Summarize my Excel dashboard."

---

## ✅ 3. **Frame Questions Around Objectives or Outcomes**

### 🔹 Why: I’ll be better at prioritizing info for your job-readiness or clarity.

### 🟩 Better Prompt:

> "How can I structure this dashboard so that a project manager can instantly understand project statuses and overdue items? Assume I'm preparing this for a portfolio review."

### ❌ Weaker Prompt:

> "How do I fix my pivot table?"

---

## ✅ 4. **Use Numbered or Sectioned Prompts for Multi-Part Tasks**

### 🔹 Why: Clear structure = better response. Great when you want lessons, recaps, Q\&A, etc.

### 🟩 Better Prompt:

> "Can you do 3 things:
>
> 1. Recap what I learned today
> 2. Give me 3 review questions to check understanding
> 3. Assign a short homework task in Markdown for GitHub"

---

## ✅ 5. **Name Files and Create Categories in Prompts**

### 🔹 Why: If you treat your prompt like a file name or label, it’s easier to manage in GitHub, Notion, etc.

### 🟩 Better Prompt:

> "Help me write a reflection journal entry in `reflection/week02-learning-summary.md` about what I learned building the Excel dashboard. Use Markdown and a tone that feels professional but personal."

---

## ✅ 6. **Use Templates or Reusable Prompt Structures**

You already saw this in the "master prompt" I gave you earlier — you can repeat that format weekly to reduce decision fatigue.

---

## ✅ 7. **Include Examples or What You Liked**

If you say, “I liked how you explained X before, can you do something similar for Y?” — I can match the tone, detail, and style.

### 🟩 Prompt Template:

> "Last time, you helped me write a LinkedIn post that was personal, encouraging, and focused on storytelling. Can you help me do the same for this new SQL project I'm starting?"

---

## ✅ 8. **Clarify Time and Level Constraints**

Helps me tailor the explanation to your schedule and skill level.

### 🟩 Better Prompt:

> "I have 45 minutes tonight. Can you give me a SQL lesson with a simple challenge I can complete in that time and push to GitHub?"

---

## ✅ 9. **Ask for Evaluation or Gaps**

You're already doing this — keep it up!

### 🟩 Prompt:

> "Here are 3 questions I asked earlier. Based on them, are there any gaps in my understanding of Excel logic functions?"

---

## ✅ 10. **Meta-Prompt: Ask Me to Help You Improve Prompting**

Like you just did 😊 — these are rare and powerful because they fine-tune how we work together over time.

---

## ✅ Practice Example

Here’s a **"level-up" version** of your real-life prompt today:

### Original:

> Can you write me a comprehensive prompt explaining what we are doing, why, layout the plan...

### Refined:

> **Prompt Title**: Weekly Alignment Prompt for 8-Month Project Management Analytics Bootcamp
>
> I'm using ChatGPT as my lead instructor and coach to build a structured learning journey toward a career in data analytics with a project management focus.
>
> Please do the following:
>
> 1. Summarize what we’ve done so far and how it aligns with project goals
> 2. Outline the roadmap for the next 7 months (by month)
> 3. Give me a 1-hour plan for today’s study time
> 4. Format everything in Markdown
>
> I want this to help me stay aligned, document clearly, and practice prompt engineering as a portfolio skill.
