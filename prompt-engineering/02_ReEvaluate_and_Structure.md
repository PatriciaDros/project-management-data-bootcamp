# 📓 Prompt Engineering Log: Bootcamp Genesis & Strategy

## 🧠 Prompt Used

> Chat, you are the lead instructor and program creator for a data analytics bootcamp. I want you to create a learning path for students, like me, to become data analysts that meet the standards of today’s workforce. You are a project-based learning bootcamp. You have mini projects when new skills and concepts are learned in a technology, as well there are "end of unit" projects where several skills and concepts are combined...

> [Prompt continues with focus on problem solving, logical thinking, ecommerce/business finance domain, full tech stack, and eventual pivot to Project Management.]

## 🎯 Intention Behind This Prompt

I wanted to create a **structured, career-ready program** that reflects how I learn best: hands-on, project-based, and intentionally designed. I was also hoping to:

- Build a program _around my real-world experience_ (Project Management)
- Use AI to guide the structure and checkpoints
- Make it feel like a real bootcamp, not just a collection of tutorials
- Demonstrate skill growth clearly to future employers

## ✅ Summary of Response

ChatGPT returned:

- A complete 8-month bootcamp outline
- Emphasis on ecommerce/business finance analytics (later revised to Project & Operations Analytics)
- Tech stack: Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau (+ GitHub & job prep)
- Scaffolded mini and capstone projects
- Learning path and “checkpoint” system
- Embedded job search prep
- GitHub guidance to showcase the work

It also offered to revise the program when I pivoted to Project Management and asked for industry context.

## 🔁 Subsequent Prompt Evolution

After reflecting, I asked:

> Which has more opportunity and pay: Ecommerce or Project Management?

> What extra knowledge would I need if I focus on project/operations analytics?

> How should I structure my GitHub to showcase this?

The bootcamp was then **personalized to Project & Operations Analytics**, based on my real-world experience in inspections, compliance, and administrative coordination.

## 🔍 Evaluation: How Am I Doing?

### Strengths:

✅ You’re treating prompt engineering like an iterative collaboration — that’s how experts use it  
✅ Your prompts show **strategy** and **domain-specific thinking**  
✅ You’re making decisions based on _alignment with your lived experience_  
✅ You’ve added important layers like GitHub structure and job readiness

### Suggestions for Improvement:

- 🔍 Add more **specific problem scenarios** in future prompts, e.g., "Design a project where we analyze cost overruns in construction timelines using SQL."
- 🧩 Use _follow-up prompts_ to zoom into lessons, e.g., "What’s a good Excel assignment that mimics a real PMO dashboard?"
- 📈 Ask for _skill-level evaluation rubrics_ so you can self-assess (we can build this!)
- 🗂️ Continue documenting **why** you made changes (like the pivot to PM), not just what changed

### Growth Area:

You're _very strong at structuring_ — now, focus on **deepening each phase**. For example, when learning Python, don’t just learn syntax — try writing a function that solves a real business problem you've faced.

## 📌 Outcomes & Next Actions

- ✅ Bootcamp structure is defined, with your personal context infused
- ✅ Pivot to Project Management adds unique value
- 🔜 Next: Flesh out Week 1, GitHub file structure, and your first mini-project
- 🧭 Keep tracking your prompts here — it's part of your public learning narrative

## 💡 Insight

This isn’t just a bootcamp — it’s a **meta-learning portfolio**. Your prompts are blueprints of how you think, what you value, and how you solve problems. That is _extremely hireable behavior._
