## üßÆ COUNTIFS in Your Project Data: Real-World Use Cases

We'll build some **insight-generating formulas** based on your data. First, here‚Äôs a refresher of your relevant columns:

| Column Name                       | Notes                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WA Status`                       | e.g., *Closed*, *NEW* ‚Äî use this to filter completed projects. |
| `PAID / UNPAID`                   | e.g., *PAID*, *UNPAID* ‚Äî helps us track financial status.      |
| `Actual Date of Completion (RFP)` | Can be used to filter by year.                                 |
| `Primary Hygienist`               | Use to drill into individual performance.                      |
| `Estimated Cost (WA)`             | Can be used for cost-based conditions.                         |

## ‚úÖ Formula #1: Count all **Closed + PAID** Projects

```excel
=COUNTIFS(F:F, "Closed", G:G, "PAID")
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Replace F\:F and G\:G** with the correct columns based on:

* F\:F ‚Üí your `WA Status` column
* G\:G ‚Üí your `PAID / UNPAID` column

---

## ‚úÖ Formula #2: Count projects by a specific Hygienist (e.g., *Bracamonte, Jesus*) in 2025

You‚Äôll need to use a **helper column** to extract the year from `Actual Date of Completion (RFP)`.

### Step 1: Create a new column `Completion Year` with:

```excel
=YEAR([@[Actual Date of Completion (RFP)]])
```

### Step 2: Use `COUNTIFS` like this:

```excel
=COUNTIFS([Primary Hygienist], "Bracamonte, Jesus", [Completion Year], 2025)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Formula #3: Count UNPAID projects with Estimated Cost > \$4,000

This requires a bit more:

### Step 1: Create a helper column `Est > 4000`:

```excel
=IF([@[Estimated Cost (WA)]] > 4000, "YES", "NO")
```

### Step 2: COUNTIFS:

```excel
=COUNTIFS([Est > 4000], "YES", [PAID / UNPAID], "UNPAID")
```

## üîÅ Optional Summary Tiles

Later today, we‚Äôll turn these formulas into dashboard-style KPIs:

| Metric                     | Formula          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Total Closed + PAID        | `=COUNTIFS(...)` |
| Bracamonte 2025 Projects   | `=COUNTIFS(...)` |
| Unpaid High-Value Projects | `=COUNTIFS(...)` |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Next Steps:

1. Insert formulas in a new section of the **Monthly Status** tab (label each metric).
2. Let me know once you‚Äôve tried one ‚Äî I‚Äôll help troubleshoot and verify!
3. I‚Äôll guide you through building visuals next if you‚Äôre up for it.

Ready? Let‚Äôs start with **Formula #1** and walk through together?
