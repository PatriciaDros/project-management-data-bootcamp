# Git & GitHub: Setup, Commands, and Rationale

## 📌 Purpose
This section documents all Git-related steps taken to:
- Track and manage bootcamp progress
- Store private learning reflections
- Clean up unnecessary files
- Prepare a GitHub repository using GitHub Desktop and VS Code

---

## 🗂️ Repository Setup (GitHub Desktop)

### ✅ Why Use a Separate Private Repo?
- To isolate **personal learning analysis** from your public project dashboards.
- Keeps sensitive or reflective content (e.g. performance reviews) off your main repo.

### 📁 Local Repo Location
```text
C:\Users\reception\Desktop\OTHER\project-management-data-bootcamp\progress-notes
````

This is acceptable as long as it’s easy to access and you’re consistent with its location.

## 🛠️ VS Code + GitHub Desktop Workflow

### Step 1: Create a `.gitignore` File

#### ❓ Why?

To **exclude files** you don’t want tracked by Git (like system files or private configs).

#### 📌 Contents we used:

```gitignore
# macOS system file
.DS_Store

# VSCode project settings
.vscode/

# Python cache
__pycache__/

# Excel temporary files
~$*

# OS temp files
Thumbs.db
```

#### ✅ How to Save It in VS Code

* Paste contents in `.gitignore`
* Save using `Cmd+S` or `File > Save`

---

## 🧼 Cleaning Up Tracked System Files

### Problem:

`.DS_Store` was already committed to your repo before it was added to `.gitignore`.

### Solution (to be run in terminal):

```bash
git rm --cached .DS_Store
git commit -m "Remove .DS_Store from repo"
git push
```

#### ❓ Why?

* `git rm --cached` removes the file from the repo (but not your system).
* `.gitignore` prevents it from being added again in the future.

---

## 🚨 VS Code Error: "Git Not Found"

### ⚠️ What Happened?

On your **Windows PC**, VS Code showed:

> Git not found. Do you want to download it?

#### ✅ Fix:

* Click “Yes” or manually install Git from: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

## 💡 Other Key Git Reminders

### Do I Select a Git Ignore Template When Creating the Repo?

* **No**, you already created a custom `.gitignore`, so you don’t need to select one during repo setup.
