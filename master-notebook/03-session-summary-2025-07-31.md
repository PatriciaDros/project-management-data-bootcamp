# 📅 **Daily Recap – July 31, 2025**

*Theme: Mastering COUNT Logic, Wildcards, and ASCII Audits in Excel*

---

## ✅ What You Worked On

Today’s focus was **row-counting logic** with unclean / non-normalized data in Excel. You:

* Explored `COUNT`, `COUNTA`, `COUNTIF`, `COUNTIFS` functions and how they behave with:

  * Blank cells
  * Text vs numeric content
  * Wildcards (`*`, `?`)
* Troubleshot wildcards when patterns like `24S*` didn’t work due to characters like hyphens
* Used helper columns like `=IF(U2<>"", "Has Data", "Empty")` to audit cell content
* Audited text with ASCII using `CODE()`, `LEFT()`, `MID()`
* Began designing an **ASCII Audit column** to validate row prefix patterns (e.g. "24S", "23S", "22s")
* Committed to a **deep practice strategy**:

  * Homework with answer key (hidden until attempted)
  * A logic map for problem-solving
  * Translating Excel logic into SQL and Python once mastered

## 📊 Evaluation of Understanding

### 💡 Strengths

| Area                | Notes                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Curiosity**       | Asked great questions about logic breakdowns and function behavior           |
| **Comprehension**   | Understood the subtle difference between literal `"*"` and wildcard `*`      |
| **Pattern Testing** | Tested data type inconsistencies and column behaviors with real data         |
| **Growth Mindset**  | Comfortable saying “I don’t know how this works” — a superpower in analytics |

### 🚧 Needs Reinforcement

| Concept                       | What to Review                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LEFT()`, `MID()`, `RIGHT()`  | Syntax, use cases in text pattern auditing                             |
| ASCII values (`CODE()`)       | When and why to use for pattern QA                                     |
| COUNT logic and normalization | When rows “count” despite blanks and mixed types                       |
| Wildcards in formulas         | Which functions support them and how syntax differs (literal vs match) |

## 📍 What’s Coming Up

**This Week’s Track: Data Profiling + Validation with Excel**

* 🔍 Build an **ASCII Audit column** to test row prefixes (e.g. “24S”, “22s”, etc.)
* ✅ Complete practice questions on row-counting in messy datasets
* 🔄 Introduce normalization: what it is, when it's necessary, and how to fake it in Excel
* 🧠 Flowchart-based logic training to create repeatable, structured problem-solving
* 🔁 Translate COUNTIF logic to SQL & Python next week

---

## 🧠 Today’s Micro Goal – \[Save for Later]

**Goal:** Understand how ASCII audits and helper columns help clarify messy row prefixes
**Mini Lesson:**

```excel
=CODE(MID(A2,1,1)) & "-" & CODE(MID(A2,2,1)) & "-" & CODE(MID(A2,3,1))
```

Use this formula to:

* Decode the first 3 characters of a job number (e.g., “24S”, “22s”)
* Catch lowercase vs uppercase discrepancies (e.g., "S" = 83, "s" = 115)
* Group or filter rows by prefix integrity

---

## 🧭 Do I Need a Prompt to Continue?

Nope — we’re set!

Just come back and say something like:

* “Let’s do the next practice set”
* “I’m ready for the ASCII audit”
* “Can we review normalization?”
* Or simply: “Ready to continue”

I’ll pick up exactly where we left off.

✅ Great job today. You’re asking the *right* questions, especially when confused — that’s what separates a good learner from a great analyst. When you’re back, we’ll keep building with purpose.
