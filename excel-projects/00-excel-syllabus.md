Thatâ€™s a really smart call-out ðŸš¦â€”youâ€™re right, weâ€™ve touched IF logic before when building project trackers, and without a clear map it feels like weâ€™re circling back. Letâ€™s fix that by giving you a **syllabus-style roadmap** of the **Excel portion** of your bootcamp.

Hereâ€™s the structured flow I recommend for you (tailored to **project management analytics**):

---

# ðŸ“Š Excel for Data Analytics â€” Bootcamp Syllabus

## **Week 1â€“2: Foundations**

* DATEDIF (for durations like project length)
* Applying formats & handling data type issues

---

## **Week 4: Logical Functions & Error Handling**

* IF, IFS
* AND, OR, NOT
* Nested IFs (decision-making trees)
* IFERROR, IFNA
* Use cases: project status flags, overdue warnings, budget alerts

---

## **Week 5: Advanced Analytics Tools**

* PivotTables & PivotCharts
* Slicers & Timelines
* Grouping, filtering, summarizing
* Calculated fields in PivotTables

---

## **Week 6: Dashboard Design**

* KPI cards (budget vs. actual, project completion %)
* Conditional formatting (traffic lights, progress bars)
* Dynamic charts (drop-down filters)
* Combining formulas, charts, and layout for a polished dashboard

---

## **Week 7: Data Cleaning & Preparation**

* Remove duplicates
* Text-to-columns, Flash Fill
* Power Query basics (transforming messy data)
* Normalizing project datasets

---

## **Week 8: Integration & Automation**

* Linking Excel with external data (CSV, SQL exports)
* Using named ranges, tables, and structured references
* Intro to VBA/macros for automation (optional stretch goal)
* Preparing Excel data for Tableau / Power BI

---

âš¡ By the end of the Excel module youâ€™ll have:

* A **Project Analytics Dashboard** (your capstone for Excel)
* Multiple mini-labs stored in your repo (COUNTIFS, DATE functions, Logical rules, etc.)
* A clean GitHub repo that shows your journey step-by-step

---

ðŸ‘‰ Based on this roadmap, weâ€™re **closing out Week 3 (Date/Time)** right now. Next week is indeed **Logical Functions**, but this time it will be deeper and systematic â€” not just a passing use of IF.

Would you like me to turn this syllabus into a **markdown file** (`Excel_Bootcamp_Syllabus.md`) for your GitHub so you always have the map in front of you?
