Hi Tricia! You're doing great by keeping momentum and moving forward.

### ✅ Based on our current bootcamp plan and your pace, **today’s next topic** is:

---

## 📌 **Excel Topic: COUNTIFS and Logical Conditions**

This builds directly on COUNTIF and sets the stage for more advanced Excel logic you'll need in project analytics.

---

### 🧠 **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, you’ll be able to:

* Use `COUNTIFS` to count rows based on **multiple conditions**
* Nest logic like `=COUNTIFS(range1, crit1, range2, crit2, ...)`
* Apply to **project status tracking** (e.g., count all "PAID" jobs in Brooklyn that are "Closed")

### 📊 Practice Prompts (we’ll do these today)

**1. How many projects are marked as "Closed" AND "Paid"?**
→ `=COUNTIFS(WA_Status_Range, "Closed", Paid_Unpaid_Range, "PAID")`

**2. How many projects were performed by a specific Hygienist in 2025?**

**3. How many projects had an Estimated Cost greater than \$4,000 AND are still "Unpaid"?**

---

Would you like to:

* Start with warm-up prompts on sample data?
* Or jump into applying `COUNTIFS` directly in your **Monthly Status** sheet?

Either way, I’ll guide you with formulas and walk you through step by step. Let’s go! 💪
