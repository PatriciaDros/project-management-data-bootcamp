Perfect â€” weâ€™ll treat this like a **lecture module** instead of a quiz. Youâ€™ll get an overview, real-world examples tied to your dataset, and a few **end-of-topic questions** to check your understanding (but no heavy drills yet).

# ðŸ“… Excel Bootcamp â€” DATE & TIME Functions (Lecture)

## 1. Why Dates Matter in Project Analytics

In project management (like your asbestos/mold inspections), dates help you answer:

* How long did a job take from start to finish?
* Is a payment overdue?
* How many business days are left before a deadline?
* What month/quarter had the most work?

Excel has **serial numbers** behind the scenes for dates (e.g., Jan 1, 1900 = 1). This means you can calculate with them just like numbers.

## 2. Core Date Functions

### ðŸŸ¢ TODAY() & NOW()

* `=TODAY()` â†’ Returns todayâ€™s date.
* `=NOW()` â†’ Returns current date *and* time.
  **Use case:** Auto-fill report dates without typing.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY()

* `=YEAR(A2)` â†’ Extracts the year from a date.
* `=MONTH(A2)` â†’ Extracts the month (1â€“12).
* `=DAY(A2)` â†’ Extracts the day (1â€“31).
  **Use case:** Split invoice date into Year/Month for reporting.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ DATEDIF(start, end, "unit")

* `"d"` = days, `"m"` = months, `"y"` = years
* `=DATEDIF(Start_Date, End_Date, "d")` â†’ Days between two dates.
  **Use case:** How many days did a job take from start to finish?

---

### ðŸŸ¢ NETWORKDAYS(start, end, \[holidays])

* Excludes weekends, and optionally holidays.
* `=NETWORKDAYS(A2, B2)` â†’ Business days between two dates.
  **Use case:** Time to complete inspection *excluding weekends*.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ WORKDAY(start, days, \[holidays])

* Adds business days to a start date.
* `=WORKDAY(A2, 10)` â†’ Returns the date 10 business days after A2.
  **Use case:** Calculate due dates based on standard turnaround.

## 3. Real-World Example (Your Dataset Style)

Imagine columns:

| WA # | Start Date | End Date | Invoice Date | Payment Date |
| ---- | ---------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 101  | 7/1/2025   | 7/7/2025 | 7/10/2025    | 7/25/2025    |

Possible formulas:

* **Job Duration (calendar days):**
  `=DATEDIF(B2, C2, "d")` â†’ 6 days
* **Business Days Duration:**
  `=NETWORKDAYS(B2, C2)` â†’ 5 days
* **Days Until Payment:**
  `=DATEDIF(D2, E2, "d")` â†’ 15 days
* **Overdue Flag:**
  `=IF(E2="", IF(TODAY()>D2+30, "Overdue","Pending"), "Paid")`

## 4. End-of-Topic Questions (light check-in)

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between `TODAY()` and `NOW()`?
2. If Start Date = 8/1/2025 and End Date = 8/19/2025, what would `=DATEDIF(Start, End, "d")` return?
3. Why might `NETWORKDAYS` be better than `DATEDIF` in project tracking?
4. Write a formula to return just the **month number** from an invoice date in cell C2.
5. Suppose your invoices are due **30 business days** after Invoice Date. How could you calculate the **due date**?
