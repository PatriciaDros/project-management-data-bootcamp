Yes! 👍

* **`TODAY()`** → Returns the current date (no time).
* **`NOW()`** → Returns the current date **and** time.

✅ Both are **volatile functions**, which means they **automatically update** every time Excel recalculates.

That can happen when:

* You open the workbook.
* You enter or edit data anywhere.
* You press **F9** (force recalculation).

⚠️ One thing to keep in mind: if you send the file to someone else tomorrow, the values will update to *their* current system date/time, not stay “frozen” on yours.

👉 Would you like me to also show you a trick for making TODAY or NOW *static* (so the value doesn’t keep changing)?

---

Perfect! Here are the **static date/time tricks** you can use in Excel:

---

### 🗓 Insert Static Date

* Shortcut: **Ctrl + ;**
* This inserts today’s date as a fixed value.
  (e.g., `8/19/2025`)

---

### ⏰ Insert Static Time

* Shortcut: **Ctrl + Shift + ;**
* This inserts the current time as a fixed value.
  (e.g., `2:37 PM`)

---

### 📌 Insert Static Date & Time Together

1. Press **Ctrl + ;** (date)
2. Press **Space**
3. Press **Ctrl + Shift + ;** (time)
   👉 You’ll get something like: `8/19/2025 2:37 PM`

---

### 🔒 Make TODAY() or NOW() Static

If you already have `=TODAY()` or `=NOW()` and want to freeze it:

1. Select the cell(s).
2. Copy (**Ctrl + C**).
3. Paste Values (**Ctrl + Alt + V → V**) or right-click → **Paste Values**.
   → That replaces the formula with the actual date/time number.

---

⚡ Pro tip: use **TODAY()** and **NOW()** for rolling dashboards/reports (always up to date), and use **static shortcuts** for logs, timestamps, or records where you don’t want the value to change.

👉 Want me to cook up a mini “date/time drill” for you to practice both dynamic and static versions?

Awesome 🙌 Here’s your **Excel Date & Time Drill**. It’s short and practical — you can do it on your lunch break:

# 📅 Excel Date & Time Mastery Drill

### Dataset (mock project log)

| Project | Status   | Start Date | Completed Date | Logged By | Timestamp |
| ------- | -------- | ---------- | -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| A101    | Started  |            |                | Alice     |           |
| B205    | Finished |            |                | Bob       |           |
| C309    | Started  |            |                | Charlie   |           |
| D404    | Finished |            |                | Alice     |           |

### Tasks

1. **Static Date Entry**
   In the *Start Date* column, insert **today’s date as static** for the “Started” jobs.

2. **Dynamic Date**
   In *Completed Date*, enter a formula that always shows today’s date **if status = "Finished"**, otherwise leave it blank.

   > Hint: `=IF(B2="Finished",TODAY(),"")`

3. **Static Timestamp**
   In the *Timestamp* column, enter the **date + time (static)** for when you log Alice’s job on row 1.

   > Use `Ctrl + ;` + space + `Ctrl + Shift + ;`

4. **NOW() for Log System**
   In the *Timestamp* column for Bob’s job, use `NOW()` so that it updates every time the sheet refreshes.

5. **Elapsed Days**
   Add a helper column called **Days Since Start**: calculate how many days have passed since the Start Date until today.

   > Hint: `=TODAY()-C2`

---

### End-of-Drill Reflection

* Which cells should stay **static** (permanent record)?
* Which cells benefit from being **dynamic** (always updating)?

---

⚡ When you’re done, you’ll have a clear sense of when to use `TODAY()` / `NOW()` vs. static entries.

Want me to also make this into a **ready-to-use Excel file** like I did for COUNTIFS/SUMIFS?
