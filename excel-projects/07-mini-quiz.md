Good morning! Love that you're ready to dive in. Here's how we'll roll:

---

### 🔍 Plan for the Next 30 Minutes

* I’ll generate a **subset of your SAI-style data** below.
* Then we’ll go **one question at a time**, each covering concepts we’ve practiced (like: `COUNTIF`, `MATCH`, `LEFT`, job number logic, helper columns, etc.)
* After your answer, we’ll review it, discuss the logic, and move to the next.

### 🧠 Question 1: Logic + `LEFT` + Helper Column

Let’s say you want to create a **helper column** in Column F that marks `"Started"` only if the job number begins with one of the known valid prefixes (19S, 20S, 21S, 22S, 23S, 24S, 25S).

❓ What **Excel formula** would you use in cell `F2` to flag this condition? (Hint: You’ve seen both `IF` and `MATCH` approaches.)

Type your best attempt, and then we’ll go over it together before moving to Question 2.

---

#### MY ANSWER
=IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(LEFT(A2, 3), {"19S","20S","201S","22S","23S","24S","25S"}, 0)), "Started", "New")

#### FEEDBACK
Nice job jumping in! You're **very close**, and this is a great opportunity to reinforce your understanding.

Let’s break it down together:

---


### ✅ What You Did Well:

* ✅ You correctly used `LEFT(A2, 3)` to extract the job prefix.
* ✅ You correctly used `MATCH` inside `ISNUMBER` to check for a match.
* ✅ You wrapped it all in an `IF()` to return `"Started"` or `"New"`.

---

### ⚠️ Tiny Mistake:

* `"201S"` looks like a typo — likely you meant `"21S"` (based on your previous prefix logic).

---

### 🧠 Corrected Formula:

```excel
=IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(LEFT(A2, 3), {"19S","20S","21S","22S","23S","24S","25S"}, 0)), "Started", "New")
```

---

### 💡 Quick Reminder:

* `MATCH(..., {list}, 0)` searches for the **exact match**.
* `ISNUMBER()` confirms that `MATCH` found a position.
* Wrapping this in `IF()` gives you a clean flag.

---

### 📍Resulting Helper Column (F):

| A (Job Number) | ... | F (Helper Column) |
| -------------- | --- | ----------------- |
| 19S-112        |     | Started           |
| 25S-045        |     | Started           |
| 22S-009        |     | Started           |
| TEST           |     | New               |
| 24S-210        |     | Started           |
| 20S-080        |     | Started           |
| X101X          |     | New               |

### ✅ You're Ready for Question 2?

Want to try a counting question based on this helper column using `COUNTIF` or something else?


### QUESTION 2
Awesome! Let's keep it rolling.

---

### ❓**Question 2: Counting Started Jobs**

Using the helper column formula you just finalized (which returns `"Started"` or `"New"`), how would you:

### ➤ Count how many jobs have **Started**?

---

✅ **Task**:
Write a formula that will count how many rows are marked `"Started"` in your helper column (e.g., column F).

You can try it first — then I’ll walk you through it after your answer.

---
#### MY ANSWER
I created a helped column "Get started" =IF(F2="started", 1, 0)
Then in a separate cell, "Count of Jobs Started"
=COUNTIF(G2:G8,">0")

#### FEEDBACK
🎯 Great thinking — you're **on the right track** and almost there! Let's break it down and refine it:

---

### ✅ What You Did Right:

* You **created a helper column** that flags rows as `1` if the job is "Started" — that’s a solid and flexible approach.
* Then you used a **COUNTIF** to count values greater than 0 in that helper column. That will effectively count how many jobs have started. ✅

---

### 🔍 Refinement & Alternative Options:

#### 💡 Option 1: Your Current Method

```excel
=COUNTIF(G2:G8, ">0")
```

✔ Works as long as your helper column in **G** is only 1s and 0s.

---

#### 💡 Option 2: Count Text Directly (Skip helper column)

If you wanted to **skip the helper column** and count directly from the “Started”/“New” label (say, in Column F):

```excel
=COUNTIF(F2:F8, "Started")
```

✔ This is simpler and cleaner when the helper column contains direct labels.

---

#### 💡 Option 3: Dynamic COUNTIFS

If you later want to count based on **other conditions**, like only jobs over a certain budget or assigned to someone specific:

```excel
=COUNTIFS(F2:F100, "Started", D2:D100, ">5000")
```

🎯 This is useful for **multi-condition filtering**, which you’ll use a lot in project analytics.

---

### ✅ Summary:

You understood the concept perfectly and implemented a valid solution. Now you also know:

* How to simplify it.
* How to make it more flexible.

---

👉 Ready for **Question 3**?

---

Awesome! Here's **Question 3**:

---

### **🧠 Question 3: Pattern Detection Logic**

You have job numbers in Column A that look like this:

```
19S-261  
20S-014  
22S-501  
TEST-01  
PREP-002  
```

You want to **flag only rows that follow the official job pattern**, which is:

* 2-digit year (starts with 19–25)
* Followed by the letter “S”
* Followed by a dash
* Followed by a 3-digit number

---

### ❓ What formula could you use in a helper column to flag "Valid" or "Invalid" job numbers based on this pattern?

> Try to write the formula or describe your thought process.

Take your time — I’ll help you refine it after.

---

#### MY ANSWER
=IF( AND( (ISNUMBER(MATCH(LEFT(A2, 2),{"19","20","21","22","23","24","25"}, 0))), (MID(A2, 3,1)="S")), "Valid", "Invalid")

#### FEEDBACK
🎯 **Excellent start!** You're very close — your formula catches the year prefix (`19`–`25`) and the `"S"` in the right place, which are key parts of the pattern.

Let's walk through your version first:

---

### 🔍 Your Formula:

```excel
=IF(AND(ISNUMBER(MATCH(LEFT(A2,2), {"19","20","21","22","23","24","25"}, 0)), MID(A2,3,1)="S"), "Valid", "Invalid")
```

### ✅ What This Does Well:

* ✅ Checks that the first two characters are one of `{"19","20","21",...}` ✔
* ✅ Checks that the 3rd character is `"S"` ✔

### ❗What’s Missing:

* 🔸 It doesn’t check for the **dash (`-`)** at position 4
* 🔸 It doesn’t check that the last part (after the dash) is **3 digits**

---

### ✅ Enhanced Version:

To fully match the format `##S-###` (e.g., `22S-504`), we can build on your logic:

```excel
=IF(AND(
  ISNUMBER(MATCH(LEFT(A2,2), {"19","20","21","22","23","24","25"}, 0)),
  MID(A2,3,1)="S",
  MID(A2,4,1)="-",
  ISNUMBER(VALUE(RIGHT(A2,3)))
), "Valid", "Invalid")
```

---

### 🔍 Breakdown of This Version:

| Piece                          | Checks                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `LEFT(A2,2)`                   | First two chars are valid year prefixes |
| `MID(A2,3,1)="S"`              | Third character is “S”                  |
| `MID(A2,4,1)="-”`              | Fourth character is a dash              |
| `ISNUMBER(VALUE(RIGHT(A2,3)))` | Last 3 characters are numbers           |

### 👇 Try It on These Examples:

| A2 Value | Result    |
| -------- | --------- |
| 22S-504  | ✅ Valid   |
| 25S-100  | ✅ Valid   |
| TEST-01  | ❌ Invalid |
| 23X-123  | ❌ Invalid |
| 20S-AB3  | ❌ Invalid |
