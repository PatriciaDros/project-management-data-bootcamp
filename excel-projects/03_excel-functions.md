### üìÅ Step-by-Step Tasks:

#### 1. **Open Excel** and load this data (from your clipboard or recreate it):

| Task ID  | Task Name | Assigned To | Start Date | Due Date   | Status      | % Complete |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| TASK-001 | Task 1    | Charlie     | 2025-07-19 | 2025-08-06 | In Progress | 50%        |
| TASK-002 | Task 2    | Charlie     | 2025-07-18 | 2025-07-22 | Complete    | 100%       |
| TASK-003 | Task 3    | Dana        | 2025-07-20 | 2025-07-24 | Not Started | 0%         |
| TASK-004 | Task 4    | Alice       | 2025-07-17 | 2025-07-26 | Complete    | 100%       |
| TASK-005 | Task 5    | Bob         | 2025-07-18 | 2025-07-26 | In Progress | 30%        |

---

#### 2. **Add New Columns**:

To the right of your table, insert these columns:

- **Days Left** ‚Äì Formula:
  `=IF([@[Status]]="Complete", "Done", [@[Due Date]] - TODAY())`
- **Overdue?** ‚Äì Formula:
  `=IF(AND([@[Status]]<>"Complete",[@[Due Date]]<TODAY()),"Yes","No")`

---

#### 3. **Conditional Formatting**:

- Highlight:

  - ‚ÄúOverdue‚Äù = Red Fill
  - ‚ÄúComplete‚Äù = Green Fill
  - ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù = Yellow Fill

---

#### 4. **Pivot Table**:

- Insert ‚Üí PivotTable

  - Rows: `Assigned To`
  - Values: `Task ID` (Count), `% Complete` (Average)

---

#### 5. **Mini Dashboard (Optional)**:

- Add a clean table summarizing:

  - Total tasks
  - Tasks overdue
  - % of tasks completed

- Use `COUNTIF()` and `AVERAGEIF()` to calculate

---

### üìù Let‚Äôs Start With:

‚úÖ Step 2: Add those two new columns
üëâ Once you do that, paste your formulas here and I‚Äôll check them!

When ready, we‚Äôll move to conditional formatting.
