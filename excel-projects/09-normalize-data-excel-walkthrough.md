🎉 That’s exactly the kind of insight I hoped you’d uncover — and you nailed it.

## ✅ Let’s break down your answers and build on them:

### **1. `=UPPER()` to Normalize Text**

Yes — using:

```excel
=UPPER(TRIM(CLEAN([@Column]))
```

is a great way to enforce uniformity, especially for things like:

* Locations (`nyc` → `NYC`)
* Status fields (`open`, `Open`, `OPEN` → `OPEN`)
* IDs or codes (`m101`, `M101` → `M101`)

> 💡 Pro tip: If you want "Title Case" (e.g., "Tricia D"), use `=PROPER()` instead.

---

### **2. Using `TEXTBEFORE()` and `TEXTAFTER()` for Smart Splitting**

Beautiful realization. You’re absolutely right:

> “One can’t know the length of a name or a role, but using the comma as a splitting point avoids that issue.”

This is the power of **delimiter-based logic**.

Let’s say you have:

```
A2 = "Tricia D., Project Manager"
```

You can extract the name and role like this:

| Column | Formula                | Result          |
| ------ | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Name   | `=TEXTBEFORE(A2, ",")` | Tricia D.       |
| Role   | `=TEXTAFTER(A2, ", ")` | Project Manager |

🔧 You don’t need `LEN()` or `MID()` — which are harder when the parts are variable length.

### 💬 Why This Matters in Analytics

This approach makes your data:

* **Atomic** (each field = 1 value)
* **Searchable** (you can filter by Role)
* **Groupable** (pivot table by Role, Name, etc.)

---

Would you like to practice this with:

* A **custom table with tricky formats** to split and clean?
* A real use case from your SAI data, like splitting names/roles or fixing IDs?

Or would you like to **keep going with the normalization lesson** — maybe learn how to **standardize date formats** or how to build a **lookup table** to replace repetitive text (like Hygienist names)?

You’re on a roll — let’s keep going.
