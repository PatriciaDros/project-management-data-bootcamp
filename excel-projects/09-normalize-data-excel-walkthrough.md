Perfect — let’s do a **guided cleaning example** using a realistic, messy version of your **SAI project tracking data**.

## 🧪 Sample Messy Dataset (Based on Your Real Data)

Here’s a **mock sample table** we’ll clean together. I’ve added realistic messiness for teaching:

| WA #  | Service ID | Hygienist | Est. Cost | Actual Cost | Status | Date Submitted | Paid |
| ----- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- | ------ | -------------- | ---- |
| 23015 | M101       | vasili    | \$1,500   | \$1,450.00  | Open   | 6/5/2025       | No   |
| 23016 | 35q        | VASILI    | \$1,250   |             | open   | 06/05/2025     | NO   |
| 23017 | x101x      | Vasili    | 1500      | \$1,500.00  | Open   | 5-June-2025    | no   |
| 23018 | M102       | Tricia D. | \$1,800   | \$1,750.00  | Closed | 6/06/2025      | YES  |
| 23019 | M103       | TRICIA d  | \$2,000   | \$1,990.00  | closed | 06/06/25       | Yes  |

## 🧼 Step-by-Step Data Cleaning Tasks

Let’s clean this dataset together in your Excel sheet or a new tab:

---

### 1. 🧽 **Standardize Hygienist Names**

We want **consistent case** and remove stray spaces.

👉 In a new column (`Cleaned Hygienist`), use:

```excel
=PROPER(TRIM(CLEAN([@Hygienist])))
```

💡 This makes:

* "vasili" → "Vasili"
* "VASILI" → "Vasili"
* "TRICIA d" → "Tricia D"

---

### 2. 🔍 **Fix Service ID Format**

We want IDs to match `M###` or `Q###`, and remove any junk like “x101x”.

👉 In a new column (`Cleaned Service ID`), use:

```excel
=IF(AND(ISNUMBER(VALUE(MID([@Service ID],2,3))), LEN([@Service ID])=4),
    UPPER([@Service ID]),
    IFERROR(
        RIGHT(UPPER(TRIM([@Service ID])),4),
        [@Service ID]
    )
)
```

This keeps “M101” as-is and converts “35q” to “Q035” if you add logic — but for now, we’ll clean up “x101x” to “101X”.

We'll refine this later.

---

### 3. 💰 **Ensure Cost Columns Are Numeric**

Est. Cost and Actual Cost are stored as text due to symbols like "\$" or commas.

👉 In a new column (`Est. Cost (Num)`), use:

```excel
=VALUE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE([@[Est. Cost]],"$",""),",",""))
```

Do the same for Actual Cost.

---

### 4. 🧾 **Normalize Status and Paid Columns**

Make consistent YES/NO and Open/Closed status:

👉 Status:

```excel
=PROPER(TRIM([@Status]))
```

👉 Paid:

```excel
=IF(LOWER(TRIM([@Paid]))="yes","Yes","No")
```

---

### 5. 🗓️ **Fix Date Format**

👉 Use:

```excel
=TEXT([@[Date Submitted]],"mm/dd/yyyy")
```

This converts all entries to a consistent format.

## ✅ After Cleaning — Your Table Should Look Like:

| WA #  | Cleaned Service ID | Cleaned Hygienist | Est. Cost (Num) | Actual Cost (Num) | Status | Paid | Date       |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------ | ---- | ---------- |
| 23015 | M101               | Vasili            | 1500            | 1450              | Open   | No   | 06/05/2025 |
| 23016 | 35Q                | Vasili            | 1250            | —                 | Open   | No   | 06/05/2025 |
| 23017 | 101X               | Vasili            | 1500            | 1500              | Open   | No   | 06/05/2025 |
| 23018 | M102               | Tricia D          | 1800            | 1750              | Closed | Yes  | 06/06/2025 |
| 23019 | M103               | Tricia D          | 2000            | 1990              | Closed | Yes  | 06/06/2025 |

### 📊 Up Next:

Once your data is clean:

* You’ll convert this into a Table (`Ctrl + T`)
* Then use it to create Pivot Tables like:

  * Open Jobs by Hygienist
  * Avg. Est. Cost per Hygienist
  * % Paid vs Unpaid

---

Would you like me to:

* 📥 Give you this table as a downloadable Excel file?
* 🧮 Guide you through building Pivot Tables with it?
* 🧠 Quiz you with a few logic questions to reinforce?

Let me know what you want to do next!



🎉 That’s exactly the kind of insight I hoped you’d uncover — and you nailed it.

---

## ✅ Let’s break down your answers and build on them:

### **1. `=UPPER()` to Normalize Text**

Yes — using:

```excel
=UPPER(TRIM(CLEAN([@Column]))
```

is a great way to enforce uniformity, especially for things like:

* Locations (`nyc` → `NYC`)
* Status fields (`open`, `Open`, `OPEN` → `OPEN`)
* IDs or codes (`m101`, `M101` → `M101`)

> 💡 Pro tip: If you want "Title Case" (e.g., "Tricia D"), use `=PROPER()` instead.

---

### **2. Using `TEXTBEFORE()` and `TEXTAFTER()` for Smart Splitting**

Beautiful realization. You’re absolutely right:

> “One can’t know the length of a name or a role, but using the comma as a splitting point avoids that issue.”

This is the power of **delimiter-based logic**.

Let’s say you have:

```
A2 = "Tricia D., Project Manager"
```

You can extract the name and role like this:

| Column | Formula                | Result          |
| ------ | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Name   | `=TEXTBEFORE(A2, ",")` | Tricia D.       |
| Role   | `=TEXTAFTER(A2, ", ")` | Project Manager |

🔧 You don’t need `LEN()` or `MID()` — which are harder when the parts are variable length.

---

### 💬 Why This Matters in Analytics

This approach makes your data:

* **Atomic** (each field = 1 value)
* **Searchable** (you can filter by Role)
* **Groupable** (pivot table by Role, Name, etc.)

---

Would you like to practice this with:

* A **custom table with tricky formats** to split and clean?
* A real use case from your SAI data, like splitting names/roles or fixing IDs?

Or would you like to **keep going with the normalization lesson** — maybe learn how to **standardize date formats** or how to build a **lookup table** to replace repetitive text (like Hygienist names)?

You’re on a roll — let’s keep going.
