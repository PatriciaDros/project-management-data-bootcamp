## ğŸ““ Bootcamp Lesson â€” SUMIFS Mastery

*(Markdown-ready for GitHub)*

# SUMIFS Mastery â€” Project Management Data Analytics Bootcamp

## 1. Overview
In the last lesson, we mastered `COUNTIFS` to count records with multiple conditions.  
Now, we move to `SUMIFS`, which **adds up values** in a range based on one or more criteria.  
Think of it as "COUNTIFS + SUM" rolled into one.

---

## 2. Syntax

```

\=SUMIFS(sum\_range, criteria\_range1, criteria1, \[criteria\_range2, criteria2], ...)

```

- **sum_range** â†’ the numbers you want to add (e.g., Costs, Hours)
- **criteria_range1** â†’ the column where youâ€™re checking for your first condition
- **criteria1** â†’ the condition for that column
- You can add **more criteria pairs** for multiple conditions

---

## 3. Examples (Project Management Context)

### Example 1 â€” Total Cost for All "Started" Jobs
```

\=SUMIFS(Costs, Status, "Started")

```

### Example 2 â€” Total Cost for "Started" Jobs by Alice
```

\=SUMIFS(Costs, Status, "Started", Hygienist, "Alice")

```

### Example 3 â€” Total Paid Amounts for March 2025
```

\=SUMIFS(Amounts, Paid\_Unpaid, "Paid", Date, ">=3/1/2025", Date, "<=3/31/2025")

```

---

## 4. Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Criteria ranges must be the same size as sum_range** â€” mismatched ranges = error.
2. **Dates need quotes** in criteria, or use cell references with `&`.
3. **Text criteria are in quotes** (`"Started"`) unless referencing a cell.
4. **Multiple conditions** use additional criteria pairs, *not* `AND`.

## 5. SUMIFS Mastery Drill

### Dataset
| Job ID | Hygienist | Status     | Cost  | Paid/Unpaid | Date       |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|------------|
| 101    | Alice     | Started   | 500   | Paid        | 3/1/2025   |
| 102    | Bob       | Completed | 750   | Paid        | 3/5/2025   |
| 103    | Alice     | Started   | 300   | Unpaid      | 3/7/2025   |
| 104    | Charlie   | Completed | 600   | Paid        | 4/1/2025   |
| 105    | Alice     | Completed | 900   | Paid        | 4/3/2025   |
| 106    | Bob       | Started   | 200   | Paid        | 4/5/2025   |

### Questions
1. **Total cost of all "Started" jobs**  
2. **Total cost of all "Completed" jobs handled by Alice**  
3. **Total cost of all "Paid" jobs in March 2025**  
4. **Total unpaid cost for Alice's jobs**  
5. **Total cost for Bob's "Started" jobs in April 2025**  
6. **Total cost for all jobs in March and April 2025 combined**

---

## 6. Question Decoding Cheat Sheet (from COUNTIFS)
- **"Total cost"** â†’ Youâ€™re summing numbers, so `SUMIFS`.
- **"By person"** â†’ Hygienist criteria.
- **"By status"** â†’ Status column criteria.
- **"By date"** â†’ Use >= and <= criteria with a date range.
- **"Paid/Unpaid"** â†’ Paid/Unpaid column criteria.

---

## 7. Homework
1. Answer the drill questions without looking up formulas.
2. Check answers by comparing your SUMIFS results with manual filtered totals.
3. Document the formulas you wrote and push them to GitHub.
